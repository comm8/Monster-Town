Its possible to interupt a sequential road if you move skip over a tile due to lack of frames (replicatable with diagonals)
Camera sometimes slowly drifts in a direction (may be floating point innacuracy??)
DynamicTransforms is locking down required features
The camera doesnt remain focused on center tile when moving up/down
